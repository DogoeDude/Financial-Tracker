# Financial-Tracker

A self project where this project will require me to force myself learning how DOM's work, 
self learn Javascript with react embedded, learn to design with css and have the ability to
compliment colors for a pleasing display, learn about firebase and to finish this self project,
I would allow me to grasp how a fullstack development would go.
